Practice Module 2: Authentication, Permissions & API Documentation
Objective:
In this assignment, you will enhance your Library Management System API by adding authentication, implementing proper permissions, and generating API documentation.
 
Task 1: Implement Authentication Using Djoser & JWT
1.	Set Up Authentication
○	Install and configure Djoser for user authentication.
○	Use Simple JWT for token-based authentication.
2.	Implement User Registration & Login
○	POST /auth/users/ → Register a new user
○	POST /auth/jwt/create/ → Get access & refresh tokens
○	POST /auth/jwt/refresh/ → Refresh access token
○	POST /auth/jwt/verify/ → Verify a token
3.	Test authentication using DRF Browsable API.
 
Task 2: Implement Role-Based Permissions
1.	Define Roles
○	Librarian (Full access to books and users)
○	Member (Can view books, borrow/return books but cannot add, update or delete books)
2.	Restrict API Endpoints with Permissions
○	Only librarians can add, update, or delete books.
○	Members can only view books and borrow/return books.
○	Use IsAuthenticated and IsAdminUser permissions.
3.	Test API Permissions
○	Try accessing restricted endpoints as different users.
 
Task 3: Generate API Documentation with drf-yasg
1.	Install and Configure drf-yasg
○	Generate Swagger UI and ReDoc documentation.
2.	Ensure all endpoints have proper docstrings for auto-documentation.
3.	Test the API Documentation
○	The API should be accessible at /swagger/ or /redoc/.
